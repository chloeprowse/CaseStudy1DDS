Introduction:

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition at Frito-Lay  in order to understand which factors significantly affected attrition and how we can use predictive modeling to help reduce it. I used the company's attrition data set to develop and compare a KNN model and a Naive Bayes model. These models were developed to predict which employees were most likely to leave and which employees were most likely to stay. The KNN and Naive Bayes models were evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. A cost analysis was included for both models in order to estimate the cost of the model and the potential savings from each model. A logistic regression model was also developed to help identify which factors were statistically significant in predicting attrition. Overall, this study uses data exploration and predictive modeling to help Frito-Lay in its effort to reduce attrition and find strategies to help improve employee retention.
